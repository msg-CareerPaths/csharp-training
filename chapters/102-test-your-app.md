The online shop application built on Cpater 1 has included the Kestrel server inside. The Kestrel web server is a new web server as part of ASP.NET Core. It is now the preferred web server for all new ASP.NET applications. By default, Kestrel will generate a test page for your application. This is a good starting point to do manual testing of your application.
