## 1.2. Test your app

Goal: 
   Debug and testing your aplication. 

- [How to compile and run your applicantion](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/ide/compiling-and-building-in-visual-studio?view=vs-2022)
- [How to debug code](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/get-started/csharp/tutorial-debugger?view=vs-2022)

The online shop application built in the [ previous chapter](https://github.com/msg-CareerPaths/csharp-training/blob/main/chapters/101-create-web-api-project.mdChapter) has included the [Swagger](https://swagger.io/) middleware. 

Swagger can help you design, document your APIs at scale and will  generate a starting test page for your application. 
This is a good starting point to do manual testing of your application.

Here is a preview of how a backend api that uses swagger looks like.

You can view all methods from a controller :

![Data Model](https://github.com/msg-CareerPaths/csharp-training/blob/main/Sources/Chapter2/1.jpg "Data Model")

, and you can test individual methods :

![Data Model](https://github.com/msg-CareerPaths/csharp-training/blob/main/Sources/Chapter2/2.jpg "Data Model")

Products App:  
  - complete the solution with the relation from the diagram. 

    ![Data Model](https://github.com/msg-CareerPaths/csharp-training/blob/main/diagrams/Chapter2.png "Data Model")
    
  - run, debug and  manual test the application with help page  

(Optional) For other type of testing, you can use different tools like: 
  - Postman (https://www.postman.com/)
  - Curl (https://curl.se/docs/)
