## API versioning

API versioning is the practice of managing and updating the different versions of an API (Application Programming Interface) over time. 
Versioning is necessary to ensure that any changes to the API do not break existing software that relies on it.
In API versioning, each version of the API is identified by a unique version number, and changes made to the API are tracked and documented in a changelog. 
When a new version of the API is released, developers can choose to update their applications to use the new version or continue to use an older version if they prefer.
