## 3.2. Publish to GitHub

**Goal:** Create github account, repository and make you first commit.

**Required Reading:**

Before you can do the exercise you should create a new github repository where you will save your work.
If you don't have an github account, [create a new account](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/onboarding/getting-started-with-your-github-account).

Read some basics about Githib if neccessary:

 - [Git Basics](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v1/Getting-Started-Git-Basics) (skip this if you are already familiar with git commands)

**Exercise**:
> - You can use this sample [here](https://github.com/msg-CareerPaths/csharp-training/tree/main/resources/code/startup_project), as starting point for your project, or
> you can use the project you've made in the previuos chapter and import files from the sample.
> - You will nedd to create a repositopry.You can co it from Visual Studio by following this steps : 
>   - [Create a Git repository](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/version-control/git-create-repository?view=vs-2022).  
>   - [Create a new branch ](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/version-control/git-create-branch?view=vs-2022)  
>
>Add new properties to the Product class (decimal Weight, decimal Price, string Description).  
>Products  will be stored each in a list, which will be repopulated each time you start the project, so there is no persistance.  
>Update the existing product controller and service to cover all CRUD operation for the products.    
>Don't forget to update the Program.cs and inject the new product category service using [DI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/dependency-injection?view=aspnetcore-7.0).  
>
>After you've tested that everything is working, you should commit your work, so do the followings:
> - [Make a commit](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/version-control/git-make-commit?view=vs-2022)  
>  - [Push to a remote branch](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/version-control/git-push-remote?view=vs-2022),  
>  - [Create pull request](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/repos/git/pull-requests?view=azure-devops&tabs=visual-studio) to merge changes from your branch to main(master) branch.  
 
> You will use these 3 steps each time you finish the exercise from each chapter.

>To keep your local branch synchronized with your remote branch [use git fetch, pull, push and sync for version control](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/version-control/git-fetch-pull-sync?view=vs-2022).
