## Host .NET in Docker containers

Docker is an open-source platform that provides an efficient way to create, deploy, and run applications within containers. Containers are lightweight, standalone executable packages that contain everything needed to run an application, including the code, runtime, system tools, libraries, and settings.

With Docker, developers can build and package applications in a container, which can be run consistently across different environments, including development, testing, and production. Docker containers can be easily shared, versioned, and deployed, making it easier to manage and scale applications.

Docker uses a client-server architecture, where the Docker client communicates with the Docker daemon to manage containers, images, networks, and volumes. Developers can use the Docker command-line interface or a graphical user interface to create, manage, and deploy Docker containers.

Docker has become a popular tool for developers, operations teams, and organizations that want to build and deploy applications more efficiently and reliably.
