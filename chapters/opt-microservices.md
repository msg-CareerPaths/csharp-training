 ## Microservices

Microservices are an architectural and organizational approach to software development, where applications are structured as a collection of small,independent services that comunicate with each other throught APIs.
A microservice is designed to perform a specific business capability, so you have independent components that run each application process as a service.
You can develop, deploy and scale independently from other microservices in the application, so these services can be owned by small, self-contained teams.  
Microservices have been an integral part of cloud-native architectures since the early stages.As a result, they have become increasingly difficult to distinguish from each other in many ways. 
Containers are used to host the individual microservices.
Since microservices and containers are highly abstracted, they have the flexibility to operate on any compatible operating system.  
The OS can be present in different environments such as the public cloud, on-premises infrastructure, virtual hypervisors, or even on bare metal hardware.   
As more development is done in the cloud, cloud-native architectures and practices have migrated back into on-premises data centers.  
Some organizations are constructing their local environments to share the same basic characteristics as the cloud, enabling a single development practice across any locations, or cloud-native anywhere. This cloud-native approach is made possible and necessary by the adoption of microservices architectures and container technologies.  

**Advantages of microservices** :  

 - Increased Agility
 - Flexible scaling and lower cost for scaling in comparison with the monolithic architecture.
 - Easy and independent deployment
 - You can change or upgrade each service individually rather than upgrading in the entire application.
 - Technological Freedom for each service

**Disadvantages of microservices:**

  - Difficult to manage a large number of services.
  - Complex testing over a distributed environment.
  - Increased network traffic
  - Dependency on DevOps

When using a microservices architecture for you application you could deploy it on any cloud service provider out there.
I will enumerate the top 10 cloud service providers globally in 2023, but there are more :
    - Amazon Web Services (AWS)
    - Microsoft Azure
    - Google Cloud Platform (GCP)	
    - Oracle Cloud
    - IBM Cloud (Kyndryl)
    - Tencent Cloud.
    - OVHcloud
    - DigitalOcean
    - Linode (Akamai)
