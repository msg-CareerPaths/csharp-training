## 2.Environment and prerequisites

You can work using your local environment.  
You will need to install VS2022 Visual Studio 2022 - Community Edition.  
Next, install NET 7.0 SDK - this should be allready installed with VS2022.  
Besides VS2022-Community edition, you can install Visual Code, if you like to work with .NET core under Linux (but also in Windows) using bash or command line/power shell.  
Later you will need to install SQL Server and MongoDb, but we will get back to that on the corresponding chapter.  
You should also get familiar wit Git basic commands, and you should have a basic Visual Studio know how.  

**Required Reading:**

 - [Install Visual Studio Community 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/)   - __recommended__
 - [Install .NET 7 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/7.0)
   this part may be optional as when installing the latest Visual Studio Community 2022 you should get the latest .net 7.
 - [Install Visual Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - As stated previously,Visual Studio Community 2022 is recommended, as most of the examples and help links are using visual studio as integrated development environment (IDE).

**Exercise:**

You should create a repository where you will save your work.

GitHub guidelines:
  > Register an account on GitHub or use an existing one.  
  > [Create a new repository](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/create-a-repo).  
  > [Clone](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/version-control/git-clone-repository?view=vs-2022) this repository locally using Visual Studio.  
  > [Create a branch ](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/version-control/git-create-branch?view=vs-2022) called develop_your_name.  
  > Checkout the `develop` branch. During the course of the training, you will commit and push your work on this branch.  
  > [Push](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/version-control/git-push-remote?view=vs-2022) the `develop_` branch.
  > In order to request a code review from the trainers, you must [open a pull request](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-pull-request) from the `develop` to the `main` branch.
