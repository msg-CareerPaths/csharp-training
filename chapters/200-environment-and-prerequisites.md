## 2.Environment and prerequisites

**Required Reading:**

You will work using your local environment.  
You will need to install VS2022 Visual Studio 2022 - Community Edition, and get a basic Visual Studio know how.  
Next, install NET 7.0 SDK - this is optional as it should be allready installed with VS2022.

You should also learn the fundamentals of Git.  
Besides VS2022-Community edition, you can install Visual Code, if you like to work with.NET core under Linux (but also in Windows) using bash or command line/power shell.
