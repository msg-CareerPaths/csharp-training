## 6. Exercises

Goal: Group business logic into service classes and expose this logic through REST interfaces.

 - [What is REST?](https://medium.com/extend/what-is-rest-a-simple-explanation-for-beginners-part-1-introduction-b4a072f8740f) - Parts 1 and 2
 

Products App:
 > Create a simple backend web rest API for exposing the products and product categories: 
 >
 > - Define a DTO (data transfer object) POJO which combines the properties from a product and its respective category. 
 > - Create a service class which uses the repositories in order to: create, update, delete, read by ID and read all the product (as DTO instances).
 > - Build a REST Controller which uses this service.
 >
 > Create a service class that handles the creation of orders. The following constraints apply:
 >
 > - You get a single C# object as input. This object will contain the order timestamp, the delivery address and a list of products (product ID and quantity) contained in the order.
 > - You return an Order entity if the operation was successful. If not, you throw an exception.
 > - The service has to select a strategy for finding from which locations should the products be taken. The strategy should be selected based on a `@Configuration`. The following initial strategies should be created: 
 >   - **Single location** - find a single location that has all the required products (with the required quantities) in stock. If there are more such locations, simply take the first one based on the ID.
 >   - **Most abundant** - take each product from the location which has the largest stock for that particular product.
 > - The service then runs the strategy, obtaining a list of objects with the following structure: location, product, quantity (= how many items of the given product are taken from the given location). If the strategy is unable to find a suitable set of locations, it should throw an exception.
 > - The stocks are be updated by subtracting the shipped goods. 
 > - Afterwards the order is persisted in the database and returned.
 > 
 > Create a Rest Controller for the "Create order" operation, which should have a `POST` mapping accepting a JSON request body and producing a JSON response body.
 >
 > Create 3 unit tests for any method from any controller from your project.
