## 6.3. Razor vs. Blazor

* [__Razor__](https://www.learnrazorpages.com/) is a templating engine that combines C# with HTML to build dynamic web content.

* [__Blazor__](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/blazor/?view=aspnetcore-8.0) is a component-based, single-page app framework for building client-side web apps using .NET that works well with all modern browsers via WebAssembly for client-side Blazor. Server-side Blazor ASP.NET Core app runs on server and makes use of SignalR connection to communicate with the client (browser). It works with all modern browsers. In other words, Blazor is a hosting model for Razor components.
