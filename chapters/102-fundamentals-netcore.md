## 1.2. NET Core fundamentals

**Goal:** Learn .Net Core basic concepts.

**Required Reading**

In 2014, Microsoft introduced .NET Core as a cross-platform, open-source successor to .NET Framework. This new implementation of .NET kept the name .NET Core through version 3.1. The next version after .NET Core 3.1 was named .NET 5.  
You can find [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/language-versioning#c-language-version-reference) the c# language version related to the each .Net framework.  

Developers can use the runtime, libraries, and tools provided by .NET Core to develop a vast range of applications, from web applications, microservices, desktop applications, gaming applications, to IoT applications.  

NET Core's modular architecture is a prominent feature that enables developers to selectively include the necessary libraries and components for their application, rather than including the entire framework. As a result, applications developed using .NET Core are lightweight and have improved performance.  

Furthermore, .NET Core offers support for containerization, cloud deployment, and seamless integration with widely used development tools and platforms such as Visual Studio and Azure. In essence, .NET Core presents developers with a versatile and robust platform that empowers them to develop modern applications capable of running across multiple operating systems and platforms.
