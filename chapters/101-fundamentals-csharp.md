## 1.1. C#.Net Fundamentals

**Goal:** Learn C# / .Net basic concepts.

**Required Reading:**

C# (pronounced "C sharp") is a modern, general-purpose programming language that is designed for building a variety of applications for the Microsoft .NET platform. It was created by Microsoft in the early 2000s as part of the .NET initiative and is now one of the most widely used programming languages in the world.

C# is a strongly typed language that supports object-oriented programming principles such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. It also has features for functional programming, such as lambda expressions and LINQ (Language Integrated Query). C# is often used to build desktop applications, web applications, games, and mobile applications.

Some of the key features of C# include:   
 - Garbage collection: C# includes a garbage collector that automatically manages memory allocation and deallocation, making it easier for developers to write applications without worrying about memory management.  
 - Type safety: C# is a strongly typed language, which means that all variables must be declared with a specific data type. This helps prevent common programming errors and makes code easier to read and maintain.  
 - Cross-platform development: With the release of .NET Core, C# can now be used to build applications that run on multiple platforms, including Windows, Linux, and macOS.  
 - Integrated development environment (IDE): Microsoft provides a free IDE called Visual Studio for C# development, which includes a wide range of features for debugging, testing, and deploying applications.
   Other IDE's can be used like JetBrains Rider or Visual Studio Code.
   
Overall, C# is a versatile and powerful programming language that is widely used in the software development industry.

 There are some limitations with the .NET Framework. For example, it only runs on the Windows platform. Also, you need to use different .NET APIs for different Windows devices such as Windows Desktop, Windows Store, Windows Phone, and Web applications.  
So, considering this, Microsoft built .NET Core.
