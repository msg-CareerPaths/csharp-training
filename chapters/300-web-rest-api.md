## 3.WEB API

**Goal:** Understand basic concepts about API , CRUD and REST.

**Required Reading:**

An application programming interface (API) is code that enables two software programs to communicate. An API defines how a developer should request services from an operating system (OS) or other application, and expose data within different contexts and across multiple channels.  

Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) are the four basic functions that models should be able to do, at most.  

REST is an acronym for Representational State Transfer and an architectural style for distributed hypermedia systems.
