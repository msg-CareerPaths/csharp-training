## Working Mode

The road-map consists of several steps.
 - First you will read some fundamentals about c#.net and .net core.  
 - Then you will deepen the theoretical concepts by making some exercises for each chapter.  

A simple backend rest api will be built with the learned concepts: a *Products* api.  
After the learning material for a given step was sufficiently explored, either some new functionality will be added to this application or old functionality will be refactored.  

Developers are expected to perform tests with Postman, Curl and Swagger.  

All the code written must be published on GitHub. Commits must be pushed when each individual chapter is finished. 
In order to request a code review from the trainers, you must open a pull request from the develop to the master branch.
