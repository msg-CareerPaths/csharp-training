## Working Mode

First you will read some fundamentals about c#.net and .net core.
Then the road-map will will exercise the theoretical concepts by making some exercises for each chapter.A simple application will be built with the learned concepts: a *Products* application.

After the learning material for a given step was sufficiently explored, either some new functionality will be added to this application or old functionality will be refactored.

The application will have little-to-no user interface. Developers are expected to perform developer tests with Postman once the REST APIs are implemented or by using Swagger.

All the code written must be published on GitHub. Commits must be pushed when each individual chapter is finished. In order to request a code review from the trainers, you must [open a pull request](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-pull-request) from the `develop` to the `master` branch.
