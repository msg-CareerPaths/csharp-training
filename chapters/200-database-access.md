## 2. Database access

**Goals:**  
a) Understanding the need and advantages of databases compared to the file system.
b) Principles of databases.
c) Understanding, comparing, contrasting, using and integrating different database frameworks into a web application.
e) Choosing and using relational and non-relational databases.

**Required reading:**  

Why databases?
* You can query data in a database (ask it questions).
* You can look up data from a database relatively rapidly.
* You can relate data from two different tables together using JOINs.
* You can create meaningful reports from data in a database.
* Your data has a built-in structure to it.
* Information of a given type is always stored only once.
* Databases are ACID.
* Databases are fault-tolerant.
* Databases can handle very large data sets.
* Databases are concurrent; multiple users can use them at the same time without corrupting the data.
* Databases scale well.

- [File System vs. Database](https://dzone.com/articles/which-is-better-saving-files-in-database-or-in-fil)

Ask yourself the following questions:  
 - What happens if you want to update a numeric quantity into a very large products/orders data file that stores for example an online shop information?   
 - What happens if during the time spent with reading/searching a large file, other simultaneous requests come for writing or modifying or deleting the same quantities or entries and what happens if during that exact time there is a power shortage?   
 - Can databases address some of these problems?   

There are many database out there where you can store your information.    
Further we will integrate our exercise app with SQL and MongoDB databases.
